# RFM segmentation using SQL

On a database I obtained online, I performed rudimentary EDA and RFM analysis for this project. I wish I knew more about it to tell you about it, but I discovered it on a random blog that had a link to a github repository. From what I can tell, it was found on Kaggle. As it didn't need much in the way of cleaning up, I felt it would be a good project to work on.


## Dataset

Data from what seems to be a company doing business in the automotive industry is included in the dataset's main table. They deal in ships, classic vehicles, and everything in between, and sell to other companies all around the world. Each order's fundamental details are included in the dataset, such as the customer's name and address, the country from which the order originated, the order's current status, the order's creation date and time, the product in question, and so on.

## Analysis

I began by studying the information at hand, including the nations the company served, the goods it offered, the years of sales statistics (if any), etc. To improve my familiarity with the business, I next went on to develop queries that would illuminate the interrelationships between a number of these statistics. For instance, I uncovered the annual revenue, best-selling product, and revenue generated by each product in the company's inventory.

First I started with searching the distinct values in the database

through which I got to know what should I make visualisations of.

By grouping variables and then placing it in a descending order I got to know max of each

As you can see in the product line classic cars did have the highest sales then in the year of 2004 were the largest revenue generated and most of the dealsize were medium.

In the month of December highest sales were made of 301.

Using RFM analysis I found out who were the lost customers, potential churn, active, loyal, slipping away.

Recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) analysis is a CRM strategy for determining and prioritizing a company's most valued clients. It's founded on the belief that a customer's worth to a company can be determined by their recency of purchase, frequency of purchase, and average order value (how much the customer spends). By looking at these three metrics, a company may zero in on its most profitable clientele and focus its advertising efforts there. It's common sense that a company would want to target its marketing efforts on its most valued customers, who are those who have recently purchased, make many purchases per year, and spend a considerable amount of money. Opportunities to boost revenue and strengthen relationships with existing customers may be uncovered via RFM research. The goal of this project was to use SQL to do a Recency-Frequency-Money (RFM) analysis of sales data in order to determine which clients are the most profitable to pursue further.
